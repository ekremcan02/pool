In 2015 we decided to make game which doesn’t exist in whole world which named CrazyFarm (game type name) with ElitIceNetwork name. In 2016 year, we got “Golden Game Server” award from Minecraftturk (which is biggest Minecraft community in Turkey) forum. Due our founder started work in Batıhost Network Services (which is biggest Minecraft game hosting in Turkey) administration team dedicated to close game server. In 07/07/2017 we created our fundamental brand named Iceplus Cloud. Our first trademark was Voice of Students Foundation. Which students can able to ask queries which they wonder or share their thoughts. We published our first web-based software and mobile applications to their stores.
